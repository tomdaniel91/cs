      "about_me": "CURRENT MISSION\r\n\r\nTravelling when I can and blogging üòé\r\n\r\nABOUT ME\r\n\r\nHi, I'm Tom-Daniel, the runaway Viking from Norway.\r\n\r\nViking\r\nJust in case you wonder about the Viking part; go back a thousand years and Norway was filled with Vikings whom traveled the world. Hence runaway Viking, except I don't sail in a wooden ship and carry a sword.\r\n\r\nOrigin of this Viking\r\nI was born and bred in Norway, a cold country in the Northern Europe that's often associated with polar bears, snow and oil.\r\nI grew up in a small city, Hokksund, before I moved to a small village, √Öros, when I was 10 years old. Though I've never been diagnosed with ADHD, I've always had a ton of energy. A feel or restlessness in me. My mother got told on many a teacher-parent meeting that \"...you're son is well behaved, polite and stays in his seat, but he hardly ever sits STILL in his seat.\". \r\n\r\nI could bore you with my childhood and everything in it, but very much doubt that you'd be THAT interested in all of that. To sum it up in a few short words; I had a normal childhood and a great family around me. Instead I'll focus on the travel- and adventure part of my life.\r\n\r\nTravel bug\r\nIf there is something that could be classified as a travel bug, I'm pretty sure I've got it. Growing up I liked experiencing new things and places. Didn't have to be something major like flying to the other side of the world, it could be a simple day trip to the closest big city. I owe a lot of the travel experiences in my early childhood to my mom. My mom, being a single mom, did her very best to ensure that I'd have all the same experiences like any other kid. She worked hard so that I'd have the opportunity to travel and experience new things.\r\nBesides going to Sweden at least once a year, I went to Greece for the first time when I was 8. I remember all the new tastes, smells, language and culture. During that holiday, I picked up a fair few Greek words. I was smitten. Smitten with travel.\r\nWhy travel?\r\n‚ÄúTravel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness.‚Äù ‚Äì Mark Twain\r\nThat quote by American author Mark Twain, pretty much sums up the advantages of travelling in one single sentence. By knowing other types of cultures, languages and people you become rich. Rich on knowledge, the best kind.\r\n\r\nEver since I saw Eurotrip (2004) I was hooked with the idea of travelling. Of living in the now. From the first time I watched that film I knew I wanted to travel. After three amazing years in college (US: high school) in Norway, I went on to study at Swansea Metropolitan University in Wales (UK). There I met some of the most amazing people whom I became incredibly close to. I gained a second family there.\r\n\r\nBut there is also another reason why I decided to really go for it now. In January 2013 I had an accident which resulted in me having surgery, six weeks in a cast and three months of physio. Anyway, not going to sob over that. Stuff happen. But that experience kinda changed me. Even though the accident was far from fatal, I got a scare. In April my physiotherapist said that if I don't keep up a high activity level, I might not never be able to fully run again. That message, shocked me and pushed me towards my plan of travelling! After a year of adventures in Australia and New Zealand, becoming the first Norwegian to cross Australia by bike, I returned to Norway and volunteered for one year military service. \r\nAfter my year ended, I was offered a civilian contract with the Norwegian Armed Forces Media Centre. Loving my job and travel when I can! Wish I could do more travelling... \r\n\r\nPHILOSOPHY\r\n\r\n#YOLO\r\nStop trying to please everyone. You can't make an omelet without cracking a few eggs, so stop trying. Live your life the way you want it.\r\n\r\nI've come to realise that life is too short and you simply have to make the most of it. Who knows what will happen tomorrow?",

Besides that The Hunger Game series, Lorien Legacies and Harry Potter series.\r\n\r\nAs for music, I'm quite diverse. I'm open to most things, all depends on the beat really. I love P!nk and Katy Perry, but at the same time enjoy ACDC and Eminem.",

            "body": "SUBJECT: Rural Couchsurfing\n\nHei\n\nDette er en invitasjon til deg som bor utenfor v√•re\nst√∏rste byer og tettsteder. Som du/dere sikker har\nlagt merke til har byer st√∏rre attraksjon for surfere\nenn steder som ligger langt fra allfarvei. Det er det\nsamme over hele verden. De som bor i byer drar til seg\nmajoriteten av de reisende. P√• CS f√•r det den\neffekten at de som bor i byer blir over√∏ste med\nsofaforf√∏relser, mens vi som bor p√• landet f√•r ingen\neller f√•. Om du er et medlem som √∏nsker deg flere\nbes√∏k p√• sofaen, s√• er dette opplegget beregnet p√•\ndeg:\n\nRural Couchsurfing.\n\nDet finnes medlemmer av Couchsurfing som foretrekker\nandre m√•ter √• reise p√• enn √• hoppe fra en storby\ntil den neste. De som er mer interessert i √• finne det\ngenuine av at land og som vil treffe vanlig mennesker i\nderes hverdag, de som liker n√¶rhet til natur, sj√∏ og\nkyst. Derfor finnes det grupper for de som bor og tar i\nmot gjester utenfor byer og tettsteder. Du kan lese mer\nom tanken bak Rural Couchsurfing p√• CS-Wiki p√• denne\nlinken:\n\nhttp://wiki.couchsurfing.com/en/Rural_CouchSurfing\n\nDet finnes allerede en gruppe som handler om rural (det\nmotsatte av urban) med diskusjoner p√• engelsk:\n\nhttp://www.couchsurfing.org/group.html?gid=9949\n\nN√• starter vi ogs√• en undergruppe (subgroup) til\ndenne som vi kaller Rural Couchsurfing ‚Äì Scandinavia.\nDerav innledningen til dette brevet. Vi sender dette\nbrevet til alle profiler vi klarer √• finne som stemmer\nmed ordet rural og som bor i Danmark, Norge eller\nSverige, til deg som bor p√• landet, i mindre byer\neller tettsteder. Vi inviterer deg til √• bli med i\ndenne gruppen som er beregnet p√• at folk som s√∏ker\netter profiler utenom tettstedene skal lettere finne\ndin profil. Dessuten kan du komme i kontakt med andre\ncouchsurfere som ogs√• bor i grisgrendte str√∏k eller\np√• landet. Dette konseptet ble f√∏rst utviklet i\nFrankrike og siden i Spania og Portugal og n√• finnes\ndet ogs√• i Australia. De har liknende undergrupper\nunder Rural Couchsurfing p√• samme m√•te som for\nSkandinavia. Disse gruppene har dessuten laget google\nkart som viser hvor de forskjellige medlemmene bor.\nDette har f√∏rt til at medlemmene har f√•tt betydelig\nflere foresp√∏rsler og flere gjester. (√Ö v√¶re med p√•\ndette kartet er selvf√∏lgelig frivillig for den\nenkelte). Du kan se et slikt kart her:\n\nhttp://maps.google.com/maps/ms?hl=en&ie=UTF8&t=p&msa=0&ll=46.920255,3.427734&spn=13.657503,28.300781&z=5&msid=1131440555289295464\n46.0004605cd5254b0b0620c\n\nS√• om dette er interessant for deg, bli med i v√•r nye\ngruppe for ‚Äùrural Skandinavia‚Äù s√• fortsetter vi\ndiskusjonen der. NB. Du kan godt poste p√• dansk, norsk\neller svensk i denne gruppen, men vi forst√•r\nselvf√∏lgelig ogs√• engelsk.

Hopefully you have managed to make other arrangements for the weekend.\n\nBest of luck!\n\nPS. LOCAL TIPS:\n- Take bus 2(A/B/C) to Mumbles and have a walk around\n- Visit Swansea Market\n- In city centre, go to MAD COW milkshake bar. Best milkshake bar in town. If John, the owner, is working please say hi from \"Tom, the Norwegian guy\"\n- Good and cheap food? Starvin' Jacks in ton centre, just by Swansea Market\n- If you can, go to Pembrokeshire or Carmarthenshire net. AMAZING \n\nTom-Daniel L.",

Sadly I didn't get any answer to my other requests. I couldn't really figure out if you have space to host, so I thought I'd just ask.

I've like your page on Facebook and will make sure I keep up to date with your trip. Sounds great!\n\nThe reason I'm messaging you, is because in just over six weeks I'm flying into Perth. From here I plan on starting my journey cycling to Brisbane to raise money for two childrens charities.\nI was wondering if you had any suggestions where in Perth I'd be best of getting a touring bike. I've had a look online and found a few dotted around the city, but thought I'd be better off chatting to a local cyclist.\n\nAny suggestions? Would be for tarmac/sealed roads and a maximum of 1200AUD. I don't mind second hand.\n\nCheers mate! And best of luck!!! :D\n\nTom-Daniel L.",

Visited friends there, went to Preikistolen, loved my time there! Dropped into Oslo too.\n\nI'd like to be able to host you, we seem to have a fair bit in common. Unfortunately circumstances aren't the best at the moment, I'm getting used to the cat no longer in the house after 17yrs being a part of the family. She died last week. My parents are coming back from a 6 week trip over in Brazil and Europe too on around the 10th.\n\nIf you're in Perth and at any of the events or out for a drink let me know, might see you there.\n\nAll the best, happy travels to Perth.\n\nMatt\n",

I did ski a bit more back home, but nothing lately, maybe some here in Oz. Sounds like a great way to raise funds, and for a good cause too. At the moment though, I'm still in a hostel and unable to host. Sorry. But I wish you the best with the bike trip, and if you're in town long enough perhaps meet up for a brew.

You will need to get here on Friday 15th, as my daughter Sarah plays French horn with the Sydney Youth Orchestra, and they have a concert in Sydney on Saturday 16th, so we will be driving down to Sydney and back home on the Saturday night.  You would be more than welcome to join us, in fact it would be great if you could, that is if you like orchestral music! You could still head off on the Monday if that was when you were planning, apart from Saturday's commitment, were easy going. Let us know mate. Cheers. John.\n\nOh by the way, I just sent you a friend request on Facebook... Might be a bit easier communicating that way.",

The concert will be over by around 1.30pm, so we should be back in Bathurst round 5pm, if this helps with your schedule and you can't make it a day earlier, and can only get here Saturday :)",

Like I mentioned in the public trip, I¬¥m on an interrail journey around Europe. Unfortunately I can only stay one night in Luxembourg, but planning on getting there early and leaving late the next day to maximise the time there. I prefer \"living like a local\" (like you mentioned on your profile) and prefer local shops, cafes, sights etc. compared to the tourist places.\r\n\r\nHave a look on my profile to read more about me, but to sum it up:\r\n\r\n- Photographer in the Norwegian Armed Forces \r\n- Traveller \r\n- Personal motto \"To grow as a person one needs to experience new things\" \r\n- Prefer local sights and culture (not touristy bits) \r\n- Down to Earth \r\n- Open and funny\r\n\r\nLet me know if you got any questions :) \r\n\r\nHave a nice evening!",

I have looked through your profile, you seem to be the kind of host we like :) we're really annoyed by guys who use CS as a free hotel...\r\n \r\nAnyway, since we will be working, we can meet on Friday morning (before 8.15) if you want to drop off your luggage/backpack at our place (we live 10mins far from the railways station \"La Gare\"), otherwise we will meet in the afternoon after 6. On Saturday, if you like we can enjoy the time together (depending on the weather we can plan different things) :)\r\n\r\nBefore you come I would like to ask you to give me a feedback on the below :)\r\n\r\nIf you want, we can advice you some restaurants to have lunch/dinner. Otherwise, it's also nice if you want to eat with us at our place, in this case we will split the shopping.\r\n\r\nAt home we are nude quite often. We appreciate if you adapt yourself to this, otherwise it would be a bit odd. Of course it's not mandatory but please let me know in advance if you are not comfortable with it. We are flexible and in case we can find the most suitable solution to make you feel comfortable :)\r\nAs this point was misunderstood in the past, I prefer to point out that it is not related with sex, as in general we are not offering a couch in exchange of sex.\r\n\r\nAt last but not the least, please take off your shoes in the apartment and take some clean clothes to use only inside, cleanings are a nightmare :)\r\n\r\nSorry to bother you with all these stuff but I would like to avoid misunderstandings as much as I can :)",

Couldn't agree more!\n\nI will meet you after 6 pm then, cause I doubt I'll get into Luxembourg before 08:15 But I honestly don't mind walking around by myself for a few hours :) If you've got any suggestions where I could get some lunch before I meet you guys, that would be great.\n\nI would very much like that :) I'm up for anything. You guys are the local experts and know what to see and do.\n\nDinner at your place sounds great! Of course we'd split the shopping üëç I wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nI read that on your profile :) Well, I'm not uncomfortable with you guys being nude. It's your house and nudity is a perfectly natural part of life. I've been to several nudist beaches and quite enjoy it :) Never been naked in a house with stranger before, but maybe after getting to know you a bit I might join you.\nI'm not travelling around Europe to have sex for a couch :P So no worries üëç\n\nOf course üëç In Norway it's considered extremely rude to enter someone's home with ones shoes on. So I will always take my shoes off.\n\nHope that answered all your questions :)\n\n",

The paper mills are gone, the river has been cleaned up and there are a lovely outdoor area with parks along the riverbanks for several miles. There are still industry, and Drammen is one of the most important stock goods harbours in Norway. \n\nDrammen is located only 40 km west of Oslo. \nIt is not the location if you want to know the most spectacular parts of norwegian nature. But it is a good place to stay if you will get to know the real Norway.\n\nFor more information about Drammen, check these links:\n\n-Drammen Wikipedia pages\n\nhttp://visitdrammensregionen.no\nhttp://www.drammenturistkontor.no\nhttp://www.drammen.no\n\n-----\n\nThe former CS Oslo Parties Google Calender has, as off\ntoday, been extended to cover not just Oslo, but also\nthe regions around Oslo: Akershus and Buskerud. And\nthat of course includes Drammen.\n\nTo view what is happening around you bookmark the\nfollowing link in your browser to have easy access and\nnever ever miss a gathering!\n \n\nCheck the  to find out about CS meetings, events, and more in OSLO and the bigger areas of Oslo including Buskerud and Akershus!\n",

It is important to always have a Plan B.\n\nBefore joining and posting to the group, please ensure you have read and understood the \"Group Guidelines\".\n\nIn your reason for joining:\nHosts ‚Äì please mention that you are a host\nSurfers ‚Äì please tell us what dates you are in Brisbane and need a couch\n\nIn your message title, please include the dates you need a couch ‚Äì it will make it much easier for hosts to quickly see whether they are available to host you and increase the likelihood of your post being read.\n\nAlways remember, your safety is more important than hosting someone who appears to be in distress or finding a free couch. Please make sure you have read people‚Äôs profiles and references before offering or accepting a couch.\n\nIf your travels bring you to Brisbane in more than a few days time, it is neither last-minute nor an emergency: Do not post here. You are much more likely to have success finding a host with whom you will get along well and have fun if you search for people with profiles that appeal to you and mail them directly using using the \"Couchsurf with\" button. Try to use the tips from Finding and Requesting a Couch and How to write a CouchRequest (deutsch/italiano) to help improve your chances. You can also try using the new Itinerary tool to create an open CouchRequest for each city that you plan to visit so that hosts can search for you and send you invitations.\n\nOccasionally this group will be cleaned up (i.e., people who have left Brisbane will be removed). You are always welcome to rejoin.\n\nGood luck and enjoy Brisbane !",
